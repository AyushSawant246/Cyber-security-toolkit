# 🔐 Cybersecurity Beginner Toolkit

A small Python project I made to learn and test some basic cybersecurity concepts.  
It’s not a pro tool — just beginner scripts to see how common tasks work in real life.

## 📂 What’s Inside

This toolkit includes:

- **Port Scanner** → Scan open ports on a target.
- **Subdomain Scanner** → Find subdomains for a domain.
- **MAC Address Changer** → Change your network MAC address (Linux only).
- **Network Sniffer** → Capture and save packets on your network.
- **Encryption & Decryption Tool** → Encrypt/decrypt messages using a key.

### Each tool has its own folder with:

✅ Python script  
✅ `README.md` showing how to use it

##### 📚 Why I Made This

I’m a student learning ethical hacking & networking basics.
This is my way to practice by building small scripts instead of just watching tutorials.
