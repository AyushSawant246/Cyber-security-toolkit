## ✅ Works on Linux only

---

### ⚙️ Requirements

Python 3.x

Must run as root or with sudo privileges (required to change MAC).

### 🚀 How to run

1. **Open terminal or command prompt**

2. **Navigate to the script’s folder:**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/Cyber-security-toolkit/network_tools

3. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   sudo python mac_changer.py

4. **💡 Example output**
   ```bash
   Enter the interface name (e.g., eth0, wlan0): eth0
   Current MAC: 08:00:27:12:34:56
   Enter new MAC address (format: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX): 00:11:22:33:44:55
   MAC address was successfully changed to: 00:11:22:33:44:55

### 📝 Notes

This script uses ifconfig or ip commands — tested on Linux only.

On Windows, MAC addresses must be changed via Device Manager or a trusted tool like Technitium MAC Address Changer.

Always spoof your MAC responsibly — only on networks you own or have permission to test.

### 🌱 Future Improvements

Cross-platform support for Windows using registry editing.

Automatic random MAC generator option.

Multi-interface support.
